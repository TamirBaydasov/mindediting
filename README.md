## Introduction

MindEditing is an open-source toolkit based on MindSpore, containing the most advanced image and video task models from
open-source or Huawei Technologies Co. , such as IPT, FSRCNN, BasicVSR and other models. These models are mainly used
for low-level vision task, such as Super-Resolution, DeNoise, DeRain, Inpainting. MindEditing also supports many
platforms, including CPU/GPU/Ascend.Of course, you'll get an even better experience on the Ascend.

<summary>Main features</summary>

- **Easy to use**

  We take the unified entry, you just specify the supported model name and configure the parameters in the parameter yaml file to start your task.
- **Support multiple tasks**

  MindEditing supports a variety of popular and contemporary tasks such as *deblurring*, *denoising*, *super-resolution*, and *inpainting*.
- **SOTA**

  MindEditing provides state-of-the-art algorithms in *deblurring*, *denoising*, *super-resolution*, and *inpainting* tasks.

## Multi-Task

With so many tasks, is there a model that can handle multiple tasks? Of course, the pre-trained model, namely, image processing transformer ([IPT](docs/ipt.md)).The IPT model is a new pre-trained model,it is trained on these images with multi-heads and multi-tails. In addition, the contrastive learning is introduced for well adapting to different image processing tasks. The pre-trained model can therefore efficiently employed on desired task after finetuning. With only one pre-trained model, IPT outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on various low-level benchmarks.

<summary>Excellent performance</summary>

- **Compared with  the state-of-the-art image processing models on different tasks, the IPT model performs better**

<div align="center">
  <img src="./docs/image/performance_on_different_tasks.png"/>
</div>

- **Brush multiple low-level visual tasks**

  *Compared with the state-of-the-art methods,  the IPT model achieve the best performance.*

<div align="center">

</div>

- **Generalization Ability**

  *Generation ability(table 4) of the IPT model on color image denoising with different noise levels.*
- **The performance of CNN and IPT models using different percentages of data**

  *When the pre-training data is limited, the CNN model can obtain better performance. With the increase of data volume, the IPT model based on Transformer module gains significant performance improvement, and the curve(table 5) trend also shows the promising potential of the IPT model.*

- **Amazing actual image inference results**

  - Image Super-resolution task

  *The figure below shows super-resolution results with bicubic downsampling (×4) from Urban100. The proposed IPT model recovers more details.*

  - Image Denoising task

  It must be pointed out that **IPT won CVPR2023 NTIRE Image Denoising track champion.**

  *The figure below shows color image denoising results with noise level σ = 50.*

Python can be installed by Conda.

Install Miniconda:

```shell
cd /tmp
curl -O https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-$(arch).sh
bash Miniconda3-py37_4.10.3-Linux-$(arch).sh -b
cd -

conda init bash
```

Create a virtual environment, taking Python 3.7.5 as an example:

```shell
conda create -n mindspore_py37 python=3.7.5 -y
conda activate mindspore_py37
```

Check the Python version.

```shell
python --version
```

To install the dependency, please run:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

MindSpore(>=1.9) can be easily installed by following the official [instruction](https://www.mindspore.cn/install) where
you
can select your hardware platform for the best fit. To run in distributed
mode, [openmpi](https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v4.0/) is required to install.

## Get Started

we provide the boot file of training and validation, chose different model config to start.Please see the [document](tutorials/document.md) for more basic usage of MindEditing.

```shell
python3 train.py --config_path ./configs/basicvsr/train.yaml
# or
python3 val.py --config_path ./configs/basicvsr/val.yaml
```

- Graph Mode and Pynative Mode

  Graph mode is optimized for efficiency and parallel computing with a compiled static graph.
  In contrast, pynative mode is optimized for flexibility and easy development.
  You may alter the parameter system.context_mode in model config file to switch to pure pynative mode for development
  purpose.

## News

MindEditing currently has a branch of 0.x, but it will have a branch of 1.x in the future. You'll find more features in the 1.x branch, so stay tuned.

- April 6, 2023

  The model (MPFER) of Efficient View Synthesis and 3D-based Multi-Frame Denoising with Multiplane Feature Representations is coming soon, Stay tuned.
- March 15, 2023

  The inference codes and demos of [Tunable Conv](docs/tunable_conv.md) had already been joined as test case, you can
  find them in ./tests/. Besides, the training codes are
  coming soon. The Tunable Conv has 4 models for demo, NAFNet for modulated image denoising, SwinIR for modulated image
  denoising and perceptual super-resolution, EDSR for modulated joint image denoising and deblurring and StyleNet for
  modulated style transfer.

## Parallel Performance

Increasing the number of parallel work can speed up the training speed. The following is the experiment of example model on CPU 16-core GPU 2xP100:
