    Args:
        gt_key (str): Key of ground-truth. Default: 'gt_img'
        pred_key (str): Key of prediction. Default: 'pred_img'
        collect_device (str): Device name used for collecting results from
            different ranks during distributed training. Must be 'cpu' or
            'gpu'. Defaults to 'cpu'.
        prefix (str, optional): The prefix that will be added in the metric
            names to disambiguate homonymous metrics of different evaluators.
            If prefix is not provided in the argument, self.default_prefix
            will be used instead. Default: None
        crop_border (int): Cropped pixels in each edges of an image. These
            pixels are not involved in the SNR calculation. Default: 0.
        input_order (str): Whether the input order is 'HWC' or 'CHW'.
            Default: 'CHW'.
        convert_to (str): Whether to convert the images to other color models.
            If None, the images are not altered. When computing for 'Y',
            the images are assumed to be in BGR order. Options are 'Y' and
            None. Default: None.
